This repository seeks to dispaly the difference between static library and dynamic library.
Essentially, static linking involves compiling libraries into your app or program as part of the build process. Dynamic linking lets the operating system hold off and load shared libraries into memory only when the app is launched.

This directory contains project examples on static and dynamic library linking.
