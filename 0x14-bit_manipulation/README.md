This project contains exercises and examples on Bit Manipulation.
Bit Manipulation is a technique used in a variety of problems to get the solution in an optimized way. This technique is very effective from a Competitive Programming point of view. It is all about Bitwise Operators which directly works upon binary numbers or bits of numbers that help the implementation fast.

0. 0-Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1. 1- Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
2. 10 - Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. 11 - Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. 100- Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. 101- Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
6. Endianness- Write a function that checks the endianness.
